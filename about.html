              Hi! I'm <strong>Pleasant Chukwuderah</strong>, but most people
              know me as <strong>"Praevus"</strong>. I'm a frontend engineer and
              technical writer who loves crafting elegant, performant, and
              accessible web experiences that make a real difference.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a <strong>detail-oriented Frontend Engineer</strong>, I've
              delivered user-centered web applications across diverse projects,
              turning complex product ideas into clean, maintainable code and
              intuitive interfaces. I thrive in collaborative, agile
              environments where design and engineering work hand in hand to
              build impactful, scalable solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Right now, I'm focused on creating
              <strong>modern web applications</strong> that merge performance
              with design, especially <strong>AI-driven tools</strong> and
              <strong>utility platforms</strong> that redefine productivity and
              user experience. Beyond coding, I'm always exploring new
              technologies, sharing knowledge through writing, and contributing
              to the open web community.

          <h3 class="about-section-title">Goals in this program</h3>
          <p>
            My ultimate goal is to become a <strong>finalist</strong>, not just
            by showcasing technical skill, but by thriving under real-world
            pressure, collaborating effectively, and delivering complex projects
            on tight deadlines. I'm here to challenge myself, grow, and earn
            every perk that comes with being among the best.

            <p>
              Growth requires honesty about where we need to improve. Here are
              areas where I'm actively working to build more confidence:
            </p>
            <ul class="about-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Backend Architecture:</strong> While I'm comfortable
                with basic backend work, I want to deepen my understanding of
                system design, microservices, and database optimization.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>DevOps & CI/CD:</strong> I can deploy applications, but
                I want to master containerization, orchestration, and building
                robust deployment pipelines.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Testing Strategies:</strong> Moving beyond basic unit
                tests to comprehensive testing strategies including integration
                tests, E2E tests, and test-driven development.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Algorithm Complexity:</strong> Strengthening my
                understanding of advanced algorithms and data structures for
                tackling complex computational challenges.

              <p>Hey Future Me,</p>
              <p>
                Remember when you started this journey? You were intimidated by
                the vast landscape of web development, unsure if you could keep
                up with the ever-changing technologies. Look at you now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keep that beginner's mindset. The curiosity that drove you to
                learn your first line of code is the same curiosity that will
                take you further. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, they're proof
                you're trying something new.
              </p>
              <p>
                When things get tougher (and they will), remember why you started:
                to build things that matter, to solve real problems, and to make
                technology accessible and delightful for everyone. Stay humble,
                stay hungry, and keep building.
              </p>
              <p>
                The best version of yourself is still ahead. Keep pushing
                forward.
              </p>
              <p class="signature">- You, today</p>

        <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
          <h3 class="about-section-title">Extra Thoughts & Philosophy</h3>
          <div class="about-content">
            <p>
              <strong>On Writing Code:</strong> Clean code isn't about being
              clever, it's about being kind to the next person who reads it
              (which is often yourself). I strive to write code that's
              self-documenting and maintainable.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>On Learning:</strong> The tech world moves fast, but depth
              beats breadth. Instead of chasing every new framework, I focus on
              understanding fundamental principles that transcend specific
              tools.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>On Community:</strong> The best part of being a developer
              is the community. I believe in sharing knowledge freely, helping
              others grow, and lifting as we climb.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>On Balance:</strong> Burnout is real. Taking breaks,
              watching cartoons, and stepping away from the screen aren't
              distractions, they're necessary for creativity and long-term
              success.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>On the Future:</strong> AI and automation will change our
              industry, but the human ability to understand problems, empathize
              with users, and make thoughtful decisions will always be valuable.
              I'm excited to see where technology takes us.
